Flatgame



For this project, I was inspired by some of the flatgames we discussed in class. 
I had to do a bit of research into unity's UI, specifically, using a canvas and creating the materials. The hardest part of implementing this was all of the layering, scaling, organizing, and playtesting I had to do to get it right; this included hard-coding trigger boxes, starting over entirely to use trigger components, re-ordering everything, and consolidating several scripts. The process taught me a lot about how to cross-reference objects and prioritize concision and simplicity in my code. 
Overall, I think it works well, because this was my first time making a game in Unity. I feel like my scaling was a bit jank, and I wish I had more time to polish things and add a small tutorial/intro. I would definitely spend more time on this one, but overall, I had a lot of fun with it, and am happy with what I learned.
